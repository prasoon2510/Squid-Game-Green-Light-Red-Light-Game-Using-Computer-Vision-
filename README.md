🎮 Squid Game Red Light Green Light Python Implementation 🐍

This is a Python implementation of the popular children's game "Red Light Green Light" from the Netflix series Squid Game. The game is played by a group of players who must move forward when the "green light" is on and stop when the "red light" is on. The first player to reach the finish line wins!

This implementation uses OpenCV and Mediapipe to detect player movement and determine whether they are moving or not. It also includes sound effects and a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the game more engaging.

To play the game, simply run the `red_light_green_light.py` file in your Python environment. You can customize the number of players, the speed of the game, and other settings by modifying the code.

Have fun playing! 🎉
